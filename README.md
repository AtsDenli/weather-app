This is a very simple weather app, just to practice my use of APIs more than anything else.
I'm using the Google Maps API as a geocoding tool and the OpenWeather API to actually fetch the data needed. 
Then, some basic data is displayed onto the screen, and the background display changes to a limited choice of cloudy, sunny or rainy.
